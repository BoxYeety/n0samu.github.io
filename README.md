## Web Tools

### [Flash Player Check](https://n0samu.github.io/flash-player-check)
Test whether your Flash plugin (or Flash emulator extension) is working and displaying Flash content.

### [Ruffle Saves Exporter](https://n0samu.github.io/ruffleSavesExport)
A bookmarklet that exports the save data of web builds of Ruffle in .SOL format, suitable for use with the Ruffle desktop player or Adobe Flash Player.

### [Strict URL Encode and Decode](https://n0samu.github.io/strictEncodeURL)
A tool for [percent-encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding) and decoding URLs and URL components. When encoding, it leaves any already-encoded parts of the string intact rather than double-encoding them. It's one easy box that "just works", unlike any of the similar tools that I've found online.
